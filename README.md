An implementation of the Demons of Cyclic Space cellular automata, as seen on the book "The Magic Machine: A Handbook of Computer Sorcery" by A.K. Dewdney.

Controls:
* up/down: grain size
* left/right: number of total states
* enter: quit

This a slightly modified version of the demons l0dable [I wrote at the 32c3](https://github.com/brunoro/f1rmware/blob/demons/l0dables/demons.c), coupled with a SDL implementation of some functions provided by the f1rmware.
